# PyDisPix

A simple wrapper around [Python Discord Pixels](https://pixels.pythondiscord.com).

Requires Python 3.9+ (3.x where x >= 9).

Requires `requests`, `pillow` and `matplotlib` from pip.

## Example

```python
import pydispix

# Create a client with your token.
client = pydispix.Client('my-auth-token')

# Let pydispix find your token from `TOKEN` environmental variable
client = pydispix.Client()

# Download and save the canvas.
canvas = client.get_canvas()
canvas.save('canvas.png')

# And access pixels from it.
print(canvas[4, 10])

# Or just fetch a specific pixel.
print(client.get_pixel(4, 10))

# Draw a pixel.
client.put_pixel(50, 10, 'cyan')
client.put_pixel(1, 5, pydispix.Color.BLURPLE)
client.put_pixel(100, 4, '93FF00')
client.put_pixel(44, 0, 0xFF0000)
client.put_pixel(8, 54, (255, 255, 255))
```

We can also display the image with pillow

```py
canvas = client.get_canvas()
canvas.show()
```

Or we can display with `matplotlib` to see it with coordinates

```py
canvas = client.get_canvas()
canvas.mpl_show()
```

## Auto-draw

Load an image:

```python
from PIL import Image

im = Image.open('pretty.png')
ad = pydispix.AutoDrawer.load_image(client, (5, 40), im, scale=0.1)
ad.draw()
```

Or specify each pixel:

```python
ad = pydispix.AutoDrawer.load(client, '''0
0
3
2
ff0000
00ff00
0000ff
ff0000
00ff00
0000ff''')
ad.draw()
```

Format of the drawing plan:

- Leftmost X coordinate
- Topmost Y coordinate
- Width
- Height
- Each pixel, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

Auto-draw will avoid colouring already correct pixels, for efficiency.

You can also run this continually with `guard=True` which makes sure that after your image
is drawn, this keeps running to check if it haven't been tampered with, and fixes all non-matching
pixels.

```py
ad.draw(guard=True, guard_delay=2)
```

Guard delay is the delay between each full iteration of all pixels. We need to wait since
looping without any changes is almost instant in python, and we don't want to put cpu through that
stress for no reason

## Progress bars

Every request that has rate limits can now display a progress bar while it's sleeping on cooldown:

```py
pixel = client.get_pixel(0, 0, show_progress=True)
canvas = client.get_canvas(show_progress=True)
client.put_pixel(52, 10, "FFFFFF", show_progress=True)
```

## Logging

To see logs, you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable, which changes the loglevel from `logging.INFO` to `logging.DEBUG`
You can also do this manually by executing:

```py
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("pydispix")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
